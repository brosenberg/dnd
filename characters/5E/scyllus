History:
    Scyllus spent decades serving as both holy man and a warrior on a primarily human naval vessel known as the Wavecrasher. As a follower of Procan he was considered to be the ship's good luck charm, but whether it was truly luck or the skill of the crew, the ship was always victorious in combat and never experienced much in the way of misfortune.
    The many years Scyllus spent working and fighting alongside the races of men has given him an uncharacteristically human demeanor for a triton. He lacks the common rigor and lawfulness of tritons preferring freedom and more "liberal" ideals. He is not one to shy away from late nights at the pub, the occasional visit to a brothel, or a friendly brawl in a bar. Nonetheless, he still feels a strong connection to his heritage and will not pass up an opportunity to tell "lesser" races of the splendor and magnificence of the great Triton Empires, and to go into great detail of how his forefathers battled terrible evils in the Elemental Plane of Water.
    A recent â€œmisunderstanding" with the new captain of the Wavecrasher has lead to Scyllus no longer being employed. He attempted to find work once more on a variety of ships, but was unable to find a crew he could fall into. He then thought of retiring somewhere nice, but remembered that he had spent the majority of his pay over the years on ale and whores. Instead he has decided to turn to a bit of adventure to acquire the wealth necessary to live a life of leisure.

Description:
    Scyllus is both somewhat tall for a Triton and built very wide and bulky. His once charismatic face is covered in scars and marred by a nose that has been broken countless times. More than a few of his teeth have been replaced by ones made of gold or electrum.
    He typically fights with a either a longsword or warhammer, and a shield. He also carries a trident and net as a symbol of both his heritage and his god. He also keeps a crossbow handy for battling foes on neighboring vessels or for long range underwater combat.
    He wears battered but functional chainmail and a barbute whose nose-guard was bent in a battle with some pirates years ago. He keeps a coil of silk rope wrapped around his torso and a grappling hook hangs from his belt. Two large metal chains serve as shoulder straps for a massive wooden chest he carries on his back, which contain the majority of his belongings.
