D&D scripts and stuff
=====================

gen
---
Generate things based on weighted rolls using json input files

Has a few example inputs files. Most of these also have the raw data files with them. The raw data directories also have crappy scripts to process the raw data into json files. These scripts are terrible and make many assumptions about their input data.    

TODO
- [ ] Allow option in json input files to reference other input files.

old-generator
-------------
Old script from many years ago that was intended to be used for the creation of an endless dungeon. It uses data from the Dungeonscape book, some Dungeon magazines and the Pathfinder Beastiary.

process-treasure.pl
-------------------
Script used to process a somewhat specifically formatted treasure sheet from a D&D game. It calculates the total value of all of the treasure on the sheet.
